### DRESSME APP

DressMe is an app that helps you dress for the weather. Once an account is created and the user is logged in, daily weather information is displayed along with an outfit that corresponds to the conditions and user preferences. Additionally, a user can opt-in to receive a daily text alert with an outfit recommendation.

### APPROACH

When we decided what type of app we wanted to make we spent time researching and deciding what features we wanted to have and make the app as user friendly as possible. We wanted to give the use all the information we think that they would need and not overwhelm them with too much information. After this the team thought it would be best to separate the work into 3 parts and each team member take a part. The 3 parts were getting the weather API info, styling and creating the outfits, and making the general flow of the app. Every night after we wrote code and created new features, we came together as a group and integrated our code and worked out any bugs that we noticed when doing so.
